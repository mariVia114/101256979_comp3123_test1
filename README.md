Question 1: ES6 Features
- Create a script with a function named lowerCaseWords that takes a mixed array as input.
The function will do the following.
- return a promise that is resolved or rejected
- filter the non-strings and lower case the remaining words

Question 2: Promises
- Given the script file callbacks.js, write a script that does the following:
- Create a method resolvedPromise that is similar to delayedSuccess and resolves a
message after a timeout of 500ms.
- Create a method rejectedPromise that is similar to delayedException and rejects an
error message after a timeout of 500ms.
- Call both promises separately and handle the resolved and reject results and then output
to the console

Question 3: File Module
- Create a script that will do the following:
- Remove Log files
- remove all the files from the Logs directory, if exists
- output the file names to delete
