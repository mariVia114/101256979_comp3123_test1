COMP 3123 –Test – 1 (6%)
Lecture Time: 06:00 PM to 08:00 PM
Developer Note:
When working on your questions, please create separate folder for your work. This way you won’t be
putting all your code in the same file, which can pollute the global namespace. In short, it will prevent you
from overwriting your own work and causing your code to compile incorrectly.
Organize your folder structure in this way.
